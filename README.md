Welcome to `electron_learn`! This repository contains code examples and resources to help you learn how to build desktop applications with Electron.

## What is Electron?

Electron is an open-source framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was created by GitHub and has been used to build applications such as Atom, Slack, and Visual Studio Code.

## Getting Started

To get started with Electron, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. Once you have those installed, you can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```
npm i
npm run start
```

This will install the necessary dependencies and start the Electron app.

To get started with developer mode:

```
npm run dev
```

## Releases

This repository includes [releases](https://github.com/semklim/electron_learn/releases) that you can download and run on your computer. All release version of the app for Windows.

## Updating the App

The app includes an auto-updating feature that uses [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) to package and distribute updates. When a new release is available, the app will automatically download and install it.
